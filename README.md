# Raindrop Simulation

## Overview

The *Raindrop Simulation* project aims to answer the classic question: **Will you get less wet if you walk or run in the rain?** This project uses simulations to analyze and compare the amount of rain exposure under different movement speeds and conditions.

## Project Goal

The objective of this simulation is to provide a data-driven answer to the common debate of whether moving faster or slower in the rain results in less overall wetness. By simulating various scenarios, such as different rainfall intensities and player speed, the project will illustrate how movement speed affects rain exposure.

## Results and Analysis

Results are stored in the `results/` directory and can be visualized with the included plotting tools.
